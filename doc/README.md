# Holidays plugin for MantisBT:

## Introduction
This MantisBT plugin offers the ability to define a user as absent, removing him from email notifications.
It avoids overloading mailing boxes and receiving useless notifications while absent.

## Installation
Copy the Holidays plugin folder to your <mantis>/plugins folder, log in as a user who
can manage the plugins and click install next to the Holidays plugin name. The plugin
is installed now.

## How to use
The plugin adds a new line in the Preferences form.  
It allows you to set a user "absent" for a given period (then you have to set a start and end date), indefinitely or present.  You can update it in My Account > Preferences.  
As an administrator, you can also change another user's preferences in Manage > Manage users > **User name**

## Caution
Be careful to not flood the users with messages, use this feature when its really necessary.
